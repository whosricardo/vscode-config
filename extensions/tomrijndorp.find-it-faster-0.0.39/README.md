# FindItFaster

[![CI pipeline - release](https://github.com/tomrijndorp/vscode-finditfaster/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=release)](https://github.com/tomrijndorp/vscode-finditfaster/actions?query=branch%3Amain)
![Platform support](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-macos%20%7C%20linux%20%7C%20windows%20(wsl)%20%7C%20windows%20powershell%20(experimental)-334488)

Finds files and text within files, but faster than VS Code normally does.

Make sure to check the [Requirements](#requirements) below (TL;DR: have `fzf`, `rg`, `bat` on your
`PATH`).

<hr />

Default key bindings:
- `cmd+shift+j` / `ctrl+shift+j` to search files,
- `cmd+shift+u` / `ctrl+shift+u` to search for text within files,
- `cmd+shift+ctrl+u` / `ctrl+shift+alt+u` to search for text within files with type pre-filtering.

You can change these using VS Code's keyboard shortcuts.

Recommended settings:
- set `find-it-faster.general.useTerminalInEditor` to true to have the extension window open in the
  editor panel rather than in the terminal panel.

<hr />

Native Windows support is now implemented (experimental)! Also see
[Known Issues](#known_issues).

## Features
This plugin is useful if you deal with very large projects with lots of files (which makes VS Code's
search functionality quite slow), or when you simply love using `fzf` and `rg` and would like to
bring those tools inside VS Code, similar to how the excellent `fzf.vim` plugin works for Vim.

This extension exposes four commands:
1. Search for files and open them. Uses a combination of `fzf`, `rg`, and `bat`.
2. Search within files for text and open them. Uses a combination of `fzf`, `rg`, and `bat`.
3. Like 2., but you can limit the file types that will be searched.
4. Resume search. Repeats the last run command with the previous query prepopulated.

If your active text editor has a selection, it will be used as the initial query (you can disable
this setting).

This extension has also been tested on remote workspaces (e.g. SSH sessions).

## Requirements

This plugin opens a terminal inside VS Code. Make sure that you can run `fzf`, `rg`, `bat`, and
`sed` by running these commands directly in your terminal. If those work, this plugin will work as
expected. If it doesn't, confirm that you are running recent versions of all three tools.

If you're not familiar with these command line tools, you might want to check them out. They are
awesome tools that can be individually used and make you more productive. And when combined such as
for instance in this extension, they're very powerful. They're available for many platforms and easy
to install using package managers or by simply installing a binary.

- [`fzf` ("command-line fuzzy finder")](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [`rg` ("ripgrep")](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [`bat` ("a cat clone with wings")](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

I have no affiliation with any of these tools, but hugely appreciate them, and wanted to bring them
into a VS Code context.

## Extension Settings

See the settings for this extension in the GUI.  
You might want to play with `fzf`, `rg` and `bat` on the command line and read their manuals in
order to get a better understanding of some of the settings in this extension. It will be worth
your time.

`fzf` can also be configured through various environment variables. This extension does nothing to
disable that behavior, so feel free to use those. You can also check whether `fzf` is running inside
this extension by checking whether the `FIND_IT_FASTER_ACTIVE` environment variable is set.

## Known Issues

**Windows**. There are two ways of running this extension on Windows:
1. **Natively using Powershell**. This feature was added as of May 2022 and is experimental at this
stage. Please file an issue on [Github](https://github.com/tomrijndorp/vscode-finditfaster/blob/main/ https:/github.com/tomrijndorp/vscode-finditfaster/issues)
if you find one.
2. **Through WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux). You can run this extension inside a [Remote-WSL
workspace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl).

**Not tested on Docker / Github code spaces**. Will likely work without issues as the
functionality is very similiar to other remote sessions (e.g. SSH, WSL).

**Various small terminal issues**. VS Code gives developers little control over the terminal. We
can't know if you typed text into the terminal we create, so that might interfere with the
extension. There are various subtle ways in which in which things can break, many of which can't be
detected. That said, if you don't touch the FindItFaster terminal, things should work well!

### **NixOS**:

The bash scripts use a shebang that conflicts with NixOs: `#!/bin/bash` , as bash isn't 
available in `/bin`, a work around is to this to follow the instructions in [Issue [#44](https://github.com/tomrijndorp/vscode-finditfaster/issues/44)](https://github.com/tomrijndorp/vscode-finditfaster/issues/44) 
and change the shebangs manually, after this, the extention should work normally.

## FAQ

### üïπ _How do I control the fuzzy finder view?_
‚û• Whatever defaults are present on your system (and read by VS Code) are used. For `fzf`, this means
&lt;Ctrl+K&gt; moves the selection up, &lt;Ctrl+J&gt; moves down, and &lt;Enter&gt; selects. You can
also use the up and down arrows if that's your thing. &lt;TAB&gt; for multiple select when
available. Read the excellent `fzf` [documentation](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#readme) to learn
more about using `fzf`.

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è _I'm on Linux and I can't use Ctrl+K to navigate upwards in `fzf`._
‚û• Probably VS Code is waiting for you to complete a multi-step keyboard shortcut (chord). Change the
  following setting in your preferences to disable chords:
  ```
  "terminal.integrated.allowChords": false
  ```

### üîç _There's a file that cannot be found / searched through?_
‚û• This extension enables you to search through multiple directories: the process working directory,
  the workspace directories, and any additional directories you specify in the extension settings.
  What paths are included is configured through the settings. There's a `listSearchLocations`
  command that can show you which paths are currently being indexed.

### üßò _Can you give focus back to my editor / my problems panel / other?_
‚û• I don't the VS Code API enables me to do this. Shoot me a message if you think I'm mistaken and
  I'll try to make this better.  
  2023 Update: Added a setting `find-it-faster.general.killTerminalAfterUse`. When true, it will kill
  the extension's terminal which may result in VS Code focusing the previous one. It may help you.  
  2024 Update: I recommend using `find-it-faster.general.useTerminalInEditor`. This way, the
  extension window won't interfere with your other terminals, and you get more real estate for
  previewing files.

### üêû _I found a bug!_  
‚û• Yeah, that's not unlikely. There are a lot of edge cases with this sort of tooling. Three options:
  1. Shrug :)
  2. File a Github issue. Please give detailed information as the devil is in the details. Please
     provide at least:
     - OS
     - VS Code version
     - Does it happen after you reset to default settings (if relevant)?
     - Anything special about your configuration / workspace. Did you have spaces in there? Is it
       on a network share or some other thing I definitely didn't test? Did you modify the extension
       settings?
  3. For the most up to date information on contributing fixes and features, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### üí© _I don't like `fzf` / `rg` / `bat`. Can I just use `find`, `grep`, and `cat` or something else?_  
‚û• You can actually already use other preview tools than `bat`, e.g. `cat`. I've left some hints in
  the settings. Outside of what's available, substituting other tools is not supported.

### üí≤ <i>Can I set FZF env vars that only work within this extension?</i>
‚û• You can, by adding something like this to `~/.bashrc` or whatever configures your enviroment:
```bash
if [[ $FIND_IT_FASTER_ACTIVE -eq 1 ]]; then
  FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height=50%'
fi
```

### ü™ö _Can I  build in a feature myself / contribute in some way?_
‚û• For the most up to date information on contributing fixes and features, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### ü§ë _Do you take donations?_
‚û• Thanks for asking, but no. The amount of work that went into this extension is tiny compared to
  the countless hours that have gone into the command line tools that are leveraged in this
  extension. Please support those tools instead.  
  What I do appreciate is if you'd help others find this extension by spreading the word and/or
  leaving a rating!
